Choose a professional Tetris game with good controls. Games like Techmino, TETR.IO, Jstris, and Tetris Online are some good choices.

Having trouble improving your skills? Try relaxing and spending more time playing modes you enjoy. Have fun!\\n\\nHere are three sets of tasks that we feel are essential. Although the tasks within each group are ordered by difficulty, we recommend working on all three sets of tasks simultaneously (rather than one at a time).\\n\\nA. Stacking\\n\\tA1. Think twice before placing the block. If your first choice doesn't seem like a good fit, think again.\\n\\tA2. Keep the terrain flat, as this allows more placement possibilities for different blocks.\\n\\tA3. If you are playing a game mode that has Holds, think about the three blocks you can use — the current piece, the piece in the Hold, and the next piece. Think about the best order to place these blocks so that you can maintain a flat terrain for longer.\\nB. Efficiency & Speed\\n\\tB1. Do not rely too much on ghost pieces. Instead, think about what keys to press to get the piece to where you want it. Start manipulating the block when you have a clear idea in mind.\\n\\tB2. Use both rotation keys. Instead of rotating clockwise three times, try rotating counterclockwise just once.\\n\\tB3. It's okay to go slow when you first start learning Finesse. If you can get your keystrokes right in the beginning, it's not that hard to speed up once you've mastered it.\\nC. Stacking\\n\\tC1. Finish 40L without topping out.\\n\\tC2. Finish 40L with no Hold without topping out.\\n\\tC3. Finish 40L with Techrashes only.\\n\\tC4. Finish 40L with Techrashes only no Hold.\\n\\nSet C is more flexible for individual players, and you can also adjust the pace based on your own conditions (e.g., how stable is \\\"stable\\\" for you).\\n\\nKeep practicing A1 when you have finished set C. This is the most basic skill in all of Tetris, and it is easy to master everything else when you are a master of reading the Next sequence.","link":"","id":"c0ac7760294e72a7b97ea6630123db3502b886dd"},{"title":"Learning T-spins","tags":["tspins","learning","study","guides","tips","recommendations","suggestions","helps"],"category":"help","content":"T-spin is a relatively advanced skill in Tetris.
